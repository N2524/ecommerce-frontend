# E-Commerce Frontend Performance Optimization TODO

## ✅ Current Status Analysis
- ✅ Basic optimization structure exists
- ✅ Image optimization scripts ready
- ✅ Responsive images partially implemented
- ✅ Lazy loading partially implemented
- ✅ Server compression configured in .htaccess
- ✅ Build tools configured in package.json

## 🎯 7-Step Performance Optimization Plan

### Step 1: Analyze Current Website Performance
- [ ] Run Google PageSpeed Insights on current index.html
- [ ] Run Lighthouse audit on current setup
- [ ] Measure Time to First Byte (TTFB)
- [ ] Measure First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- [ ] Identify slow-loading resources
- [ ] Document current performance baseline

### Step 2: Minimize and Optimize CSS, JavaScript, and HTML
- [ ] Minify CSS files (main.css, image-optimization.css)
- [ ] Minify JavaScript files
- [ ] Remove unused CSS rules
- [ ] Inline critical CSS
- [ ] Defer non-critical CSS
- [ ] Add async/defer attributes to scripts
- [ ] Optimize HTML structure

### Step 3: Implement Lazy Loading for Non-Essential Elements
- [ ] Add loading="lazy" to all images
- [ ] Implement Intersection Observer for better lazy loading
- [ ] Lazy load below-the-fold images
- [ ] Lazy load third-party scripts
- [ ] Implement progressive image loading
- [ ] Add blur-up effect for images

### Step 4: Optimize Server and Reduce HTTP Requests
- [ ] Verify .htaccess compression settings
- [ ] Enable HTTP/2 or HTTP/3
- [ ] Combine CSS files where possible
- [ ] Combine JavaScript files where possible
- [ ] Optimize font loading
- [ ] Reduce external requests

### Step 5: Implement Browser Caching
- [ ] Verify cache headers in .htaccess
- [ ] Set up long-term caching for static assets
- [ ] Configure CDN integration
- [ ] Add service worker for caching
- [ ] Implement cache busting for updates

### Step 6: Optimize Fonts and Third-Party Scripts
- [ ] Replace Font Awesome with optimized version
- [ ] Use system fonts as fallback
- [ ] Preload critical fonts
- [ ] Optimize Google Fonts loading
- [ ] Defer non-critical third-party scripts
- [ ] Remove unused third-party resources

### Step 7: Test and Monitor Speed Improvements
- [ ] Re-run PageSpeed Insights
- [ ] Re-run Lighthouse audit
- [ ] Compare before/after metrics
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Test on slow network conditions
- [ ] Set up continuous monitoring

## 📊 Performance Targets
- First Contentful Paint: < 1.5s
- Largest Contentful Paint: < 2.5s
- Cumulative Layout Shift: < 0.1
- Speed Index: < 3s
- Time to Interactive: < 3.8s

## 🛠️ Tools to Use
- Google PageSpeed Insights
- Lighthouse
- WebPageTest
- GTmetrix
- Chrome DevTools
- ImageOptim/Sharp for image compression

## 📁 Files to Create/Update
- [ ] index-super-optimized.html (final optimized version)
- [ ] styles/critical.css (inline critical styles)
- [ ] scripts/lazy-loader.js (enhanced lazy loading)
- [ ] service-worker.js (caching)
- [ ] manifest.json (PWA features)
- [ ] Performance report files
